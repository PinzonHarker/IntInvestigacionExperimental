  abstract = {The paper analyses particle diffusion from a thermodynamic standpoint. The main goal of the paper is to highlight the conceptual connection between particle diffusion, which belongs to non-equilibrium statistical physics, and mechanics, which deals with particle motion, at the level of third-year university courses. We start out from the fact that, near equilibrium, particle transport should occur down the gradient of the chemical potential. This yields Fick's law with two additional advantages. First, splitting the chemical potential into `mechanical' and `chemical' contributions shows how transport and mechanics are linked through the diffusivity--mobility relationship. Second, splitting the chemical potential into entropic and energetic contributions discloses the respective roles of entropy maximization and energy minimization in driving diffusion. The paper addresses first unary diffusion, where there is only one mobile species in an immobile medium, and next turns to binary diffusion, where two species are mobile with respect to each other in a fluid medium. The interrelationship between unary and binary diffusivities is brought out and it is shown how binary diffusion reduces to unary diffusion in the limit of high dilution of one species amidst the other one. Self- and mutual diffusion are considered and contrasted within the thermodynamic framework; self-diffusion is a time-dependent manifestation of the Gibbs paradox of mixing.}

  abstract = {Adolph Fick's original diffusion experiments used two vessels containing water and salt to establish a steady-state concentration gradient that demonstrated the validity of what is now called Fick's second law of diffusion. The first vessel had a cylindrical shape creating a linear gradient. The second vessel was shaped like a funnel having a correspondent variable flow area. Using Fick's second law, general solutions for any shape of the vessel are developed for steady diffusion in two and three dimensions, respectively. Two dimensional random walks were performed via computer simulations, and the numerical results are compared to continuum theory. Provided that a sufficiently large number of steps are simulated to allow the random walkers to traverse the total diffusion path, good agreement is achieved between discrete ``molecular'' motions (random walk) and the classical continuum description provided by scalar field theory (partial differential equations).},
